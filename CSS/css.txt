CSS:
	list-style-type ----> defines the format of the list type it should be.

The default list-style-type value for an ordered list is decimal , whereas the default for an unordered list is disc
 
* in css refers to it selects all html elements on the page.

================
Css helps you make easy if we need the same styling to all the web pages.
It is used for describing the presentation of web pages,include layout colors and fonts.It allows one to adapt the presentation to different type of devices,such as large screens,small screens and printers.
It is not case sensitive but we shall be writing in lower case.

CSS Advantages:
#saves time
#pages load faster
#easy maintainance
#superior styles to HTML
#Multiple Device Connectivity
#Global web standards

3 ways to apply CSS to our web pages:
a.Internal CSS(inside html file)
b.External CSS(seperate file is created)
c.Inline CSS(css for one special line)

Syntax of CSS:
			selector{
					property:value;
			}

example:
			h1{
				color:red;
			}

16px==1em

Properties:
=============
color:red
font-family:arial
font-size:1.3em
text-align:left/center/right/justify
background-color:yellow
border:1px solid red;
width: 300px;
height: 300px;

margin and padding ------> used for spacing

margin is used to give space outside of the element
padding is used to give space inside of the element

margin:30px;
padding:30px;

list-style-type:none/circle/square/disc ----------> This will make the list serial number to be like circle,square and disc or none
list-style-image:url(pic.jpg) ---->  This will make the serial number look like the image.

Selectors:
==========
			selector{
					property:value;
			}

1.Element/tag selector
disadvantage---> if we want to change the color of first heading then we cant give for whole h2 which might include in other parts of code
		ex:
			h2{
				color:red;
			}
2.Class selector --->starts with a dot
		ex:
			.test{
				property:value;
			}
		class selector has to be called.
		ex:
			<h3 class="test"></h3>

3. Id selector --> very useful while using javascript
		id selector starts with #
		id's and classes both are same but id's are uniquely defined(that is it shouldnt be called again and again) but classes can be called again to other attributes.
		ex:
			#test{
				color:red;
			}
		id selector has to be called.
		ex:
			<h3 id="test"></h3>

4.pseudo element selector
	a:hover{
	}

text-decoration: none; ---->this will remove underlines to the links.
a:hover --->this will change the background color if we move cursor to that particular text.

float:left/right ----> basically divisions are blocks which will be placed one below other.
				 but if you want side by side then we shall use float.

container ----> this will keep all divisions in one container.

#if we clear the float only we can add footer to the context.
	clear:left/right/both;

box-shadow: 10px(horizontal) 10px(vertical) 10px(blur) black(color of shadow);
border-radius:30px;
border-radius:0px 20px;
border-radius:100%;

top:10px;
left:10px;
right:10px;
bottom:10px;

position: static(default)/relative(move the elements from top box and down box)/absolute(move the things from the top page and bottom page)/fixed(the position wont change if you scroll down the web page);
overflow ---> if the pic size is greater than the width and height it just overflows
overflow: visible(default)/hidden(hides the rest content)/scroll(scroll bar is added both left and bottom)/auto(added scroll bar if its necessary only)

animation:name time;
@keyframes name{

}

External CSS:
=============

file name should be .css
and we have to link external css to html by adding the below link in html
<head>
<link href="file.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
